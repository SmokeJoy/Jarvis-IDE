# Getting Started with Jarvis IDE | New Coders

Welcome to Jarvis IDE! This guide will help you get set up and start using Jarvis IDE to build your first project.

## What You'll Need

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

-   **VS Code:** A free, powerful code editor.
    -   [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
-   **Development Tools:** Essential software for coding (Homebrew, Node.js, Git, etc.).
    -   Follow our [Installing Essential Development Tools](installing-dev-essentials.md) guide to set these up with Jarvis IDE's help (after getting setup here)
    -   Jarvis IDE will guide you through installing everything you need
-   **Jarvis IDE Projects Folder:** A dedicated folder for all your Jarvis IDE projects.
    -   On macOS: Create a folder named "Jarvis IDE" in your Documents folder
        -   Path: `/Users/[your-username]/Documents/Jarvis IDE`
    -   On Windows: Create a folder named "Jarvis IDE" in your Documents folder
        -   Path: `C:\Users\[your-username]\Documents\Jarvis IDE`
    -   Inside this Jarvis IDE folder, create separate folders for each project
        -   Example: `Documents/Jarvis IDE/workout-app` for a workout tracking app
        -   Example: `Documents/Jarvis IDE/portfolio-website` for your portfolio
-   **Jarvis IDE Extension in VS Code:** The Jarvis IDE extension installed in VS Code.

## Step-by-Step Setup

Follow these steps to get Jarvis IDE up and running:

1. **Open VS Code:** Launch the VS Code application. If VS Code shows "Running extensions might...", click "Allow".

2. **Open Your Jarvis IDE Folder:** In VS Code, open the Jarvis IDE folder you created in Documents.

3. **Navigate to Extensions:** Click on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of VS Code.

4. **Search for 'Jarvis IDE':** In the Extensions search bar, type "Jarvis IDE".

5. **Install the Extension:** Click the "Install" button next to the Jarvis IDE extension.

6. **Open Jarvis IDE:** Once installed, you can open Jarvis IDE in a few ways:
    - Click the Jarvis IDE icon in the Activity Bar.
    - Use the command palette (`CMD/CTRL + Shift + P`) and type "Jarvis IDE: Open In New Tab" to open Jarvis IDE as a tab in your editor. This is recommended for a better view.
    - **Troubleshooting:** If you don't see the Jarvis IDE icon, try restarting VS Code.
    - **What You'll See:** You should see the Jarvis IDE chat window appear in your VS Code editor.

## Setting up OpenRouter API Key

Now that you have Jarvis IDE installed, you'll need to set up your OpenRouter API key to use Jarvis IDE's full capabilities.

1.  **Get your OpenRouter API Key:**
    -   [Get your OpenRouter API Key](https://openrouter.ai/)
2.  **Input Your OpenRouter API Key:**
    -   Navigate to the settings button in the Jarvis IDE extension.
    -   Input your OpenRouter API key.
    -   Select your preferred API model.
        -   **Recommended Models for Coding:**
            -   `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet`: Most used for coding tasks.
            -   `google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free`: A free option for coding.
            -   `deepseek/deepseek-chat`: SUPER CHEAP, almost as good as 3.5 sonnet

## Your First Interaction with Jarvis IDE

Now you're ready to start building with Jarvis IDE. Let's create your first project folder and build something! Copy and paste the following prompt into the Jarvis IDE chat window:

```
Hey Jarvis! Could you help me create a new project folder called "hello-world" in my Jarvis IDE directory and make a simple webpage that says "Hello World" in big blue text?
```

**What You'll See:** Jarvis IDE will help you create the project folder and set up your first webpage.

## Tips for Working with Jarvis IDE

-   **Ask Questions:** If you're unsure about something, don't hesitate to ask Jarvis IDE!
-   **Use Screenshots:** Jarvis IDE can understand images, so feel free to use screenshots to show it what you're working on.
-   **Copy and Paste Errors:** If you encounter errors, copy and paste the error messages into Jarvis IDE's chat. This will help it understand the issue and provide a solution.
-   **Speak Plainly:** Jarvis IDE is designed to understand plain, non-technical language. Feel free to describe your ideas in your own words, and Jarvis IDE will translate them into code.

## FAQs

-   **What is the Terminal?** The terminal is a text-based interface for interacting with your computer. It allows you to run commands to perform various tasks, such as installing packages, running scripts, and managing files. Jarvis IDE uses the terminal to execute commands and interact with your development environment.
-   **How Does the Codebase Work?** (This section will be expanded based on common questions from new coders)
